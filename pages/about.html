    <p>I'm possibly the weirdest person you'll ever meet and I 
    really enjoy meeting people as weird, if not weirder, than 
    me. Not that there's anything wrongwith being normal, it's 
    just being weird is more interesting in my book. Speaking 
    of books, I love reading in my spare time, along with watching
    anime, playing video games, walking, drawing, listening to 
    music, and of course, coding. I'm 16, kind-hearted, talkative
    (if I know you) and relatively harmless. Stay quirky and
    thumbs up.</p>
